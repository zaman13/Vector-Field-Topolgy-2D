Vector field topology (VFT) [Ref. 1, 2] is an intuitive visualization technique of vector fields. It is a representation of the global topology based on an analysis of the critical points and their connections. For a complex vector field, it can be difficult to understand the field properties by plotting streamlines or field lines (quiver). By showing only the critical points and key integral lines connecting those points, the VFT technique produces a minimalistic intuitive representation of the field.

VFT methods have been used in many fields including fluid flow analysis, computer vision and photonics.  

## Usage
Please cite the papers mentioned in the reference section and this github repository if you use the code for your research/work.

## Sample output
For a test vector filed u<sub>x</sub> = -X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup>, u<sub>y</sub> = X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> - 2, the calculated vector field topology is shown below (with quiver lines and without quiver lines):

## Theory

### Integral Lines

The integral lines follow the direction of the vector field, denoted here by <b>u</b> = [u<sub>x</sub> u<sub>y</sub>]<sup>T</sup>. For simplicity, we will assume that u is normalized. Let's consider a point on the integral line denoted by the coordinates (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>). Considering the locus of the integral line is formed by a discrete set of points (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>), (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), ..., (x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>). Then,

x<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>0</sub> + u<sub>x</sub>(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>) Δx

x<sub>2</sub> = x<sub>1</sub> + u<sub>x</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) Δx = x<sub>0</sub> + u<sub>x</sub>(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>) Δx +  u<sub>x</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) Δx

.
.

x<sub>n</sub> = x<sub>0</sub> + &sum;<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n-1</sup> u<sub>x</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) Δx
<!-- <sub>x<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>x</sup> -->
In the continuous limit,
x = x<sub>0</sub> + ∫ u<sub>x</sub> dx'
