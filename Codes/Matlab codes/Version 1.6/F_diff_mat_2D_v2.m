% Constructing the 1D diffentiation matrices
%==============================================

% It is necessary to develop different matrixed for D1dx and D1dy as Nx and
% Ny may have different values. So, the dimensions for the two cases
% might be different. 

% The main diagonals are from 2nd order center difference formula
D1x = spdiags([-ex ex], [-1,1], Nx, Nx); % A division by (2*dx) is required later.
D1y = spdiags([-ey ey], [-1,1], Ny, Ny); % A division by (2*dy) is required later.
    
D1x(1,1:3) = [-3 4 -1];   % this is 2nd order forward difference
D1x(end,end-2:end) = [1 -4 3];  % this is 2nd order backward difference

D1y(1,1:3) = [-3 4 -1];   % this is 2nd order forward difference
D1y(end,end-2:end) = [1 -4 3];  % this is 2nd order backward difference


% Second derivatives
DDx =  spdiags([ex -2*ex ex], [-1,0,1], Nx, Nx);
DDx(1,1:4) = [2 -5 4 -1];   % this is 2nd order forward difference
DDx(end,end-3:end) = [-1 4 -5 2];  % this is 2nd order backward difference

DDy =  spdiags([ey -2*ey ey], [-1,0,1], Ny, Ny);
DDy(1,1:4) = [2 -5 4 -1];   % this is 2nd order forward difference
DDy(end,end-3:end) = [-1 4 -5 2];  % this is 2nd order backward difference
